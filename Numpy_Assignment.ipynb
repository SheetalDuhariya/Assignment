They allow for optimized computations by leveraging low-level implementations and eliminating the need for explicit loops in Python code. Here's a detailed exploration of both concepts.\n",
        "# Vectorization\n",
        "# Definition - Vectorization refers to the process of applying operations to entire arrays rather than individual elements. In NumPy, this is achieved through the use of built-in functions and operators that are optimized and implemented in low-level languages like C. This allows for operations to be executed simultaneously on multiple values, leading to significant performance improvements\n",
