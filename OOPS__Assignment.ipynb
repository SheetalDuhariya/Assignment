        "Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. The five key concepts of OOP are:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation\n",
        "Encapsulation is the practice of bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called an object.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Inheritance\n",
        "Inheritance allows a new class (subclass) to inherit properties and behaviors from an existing class (superclass).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Polymorphism\n",
        "Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Abstraction\n",
        "Abstraction focuses on hiding the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Composition\n",
        "Composition is a form of association where one class contains references to objects of other classes."
