        "3.Why would you apply the NOT NULL constraint to a column? Can a primary key contain NULL values? Justify your answer.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Apply the NOT NULL Constraint to a Column?\n",
        "The NOT NULL constraint is applied to ensure that a column always contains a value and cannot be left empty. This is crucial when the presence of data in that column is essential for the database to function correctly or to maintain data integrity.\n",
        "Reasons to Use NOT NULL:\n",
        "1.\tData Completeness: Ensures critical information is always recorded.\n",
        "o\tExample: A Name field in a Users table must not be NULL to identify users.\n",
        "2.\tAvoid Errors in Queries: Prevents issues when performing operations or calculations that assume a value is present.\n",
        "o\tExample: Calculating total = quantity * price would fail if price is NULL.\n",
        "3.\tConsistency in Data Relationships: Supports referential integrity, particularly in foreign key relationships.\n",
        "o\tExample: A foreign key referencing a parent table cannot be NULL unless explicitly designed for optional relationships.\n",
        "\n",
        "Can a Primary Key Contain NULL Values?\n",
        "No, a primary key cannot contain NULL values.\n",
        "\n",
        "Justification:\n",
        "1.\tUniqueness Requirement: The primary key uniquely identifies each row in a table. A NULL value represents \"unknown\" or \"missing\" data, which cannot serve as a unique identifier.\n",
        "o\tIf NULL were allowed, multiple rows could have NULL values, violating the uniqueness rule.\n",
        "2.\tLogical Integrity: The primary key is often used to reference rows in other tables via foreign keys. If a primary key contained NULL, the referenced rows would become ambiguous or invalid.\n",
        "3.\tSQL Standard: According to SQL standards, the primary key constraint implicitly enforces both NOT NULL and UNIQUE constraints.\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "The following would result in an error: CREATE TABLE Students (\n",
        "StudentID INT PRIMARY KEY, Name VARCHAR(50)\n",
        ");\n",
        "\n",
        "-- Attempt to insert a NULL value into the primary key column\n",
        "INSERT INTO Students (StudentID, Name) VALUES (NULL, 'John Doe'); -- Error: Primary key cannot be NULL\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion:\n",
        "•\tApply the NOT NULL constraint to ensure essential data is always provided.\n",
        "•\tA primary key cannot contain NULL values because it must uniquely and unambiguously identify each record in the table.\n",

        "Steps and SQL Commands for Adding or Removing Constraints on an Existing Table Adding Constraints\n",
        "1.\tIdentify the Table and Column: Determine the table and column(s) where you want to add the constraint.\n",
        "2.\tUse the ALTER TABLE Command: Use the ALTER TABLE statement with the appropriate syntax to add the constraint.\n",
        "3.\tSpecify the Constraint Type: Define the type of constraint (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK, etc.) and the rules it enforces.\n",
        "Example: Adding a Constraint\n",
        "Suppose we have a table Employees without any constraints on the Email column. CREATE TABLE Employees (\n",
